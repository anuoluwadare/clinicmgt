  <strong>Drug Request.</strong> This is when a patient comes  directly to the dispensary to request for drugs, note that if the patient does  not have a pending prescription from the doctor and there are no outstanding  drug balances to collect. The application opens the drug request form. Also not  that only drugs marked as <strong>on request</strong> will be allowed to be dispensed.<br />
  <strong>Drug Prescription.</strong> This is when a patient comes from  the doctor with a prescription. The pharmacist can search for and dispense  drugs to the patient on prescription and on request.<br />
  <strong>Partial Prescription</strong>. This is when a patient comes back  to collect the balance of his/her drug if the patient has an outstanding drug  to collect, this will be displayed to the pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for Drugs</strong><br />
  The  dispensary interface has a search engine for locating drugs. The drugs can be  searched by drug groups by name and by a combination of multiple options. In <strong>drug prescription mode </strong>drugs returned  are both on request and request however in <strong>Drug  Request mode </strong>the drugs returned are only on request, drugs marked <strong>on prescription</strong> are not returned.<br />
  <strong>To Search:</strong> enter the search parameter and  pick a criterion from the drop-down list and then click <strong>Search</strong></p>
